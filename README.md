# KeyProxyServer

## Overview
KeyProxyServer is a secure and scalable key management proxy that provides a unified API for interacting with multiple Key Management Systems (KMS). It allows organizations to securely store and retrieve secrets while leveraging KMS providers such as:
- **Google Cloud Secret Manager (GCP)**
- **AWS Secrets Manager**
- **Azure Key Vault**

This application ensures data security through **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**, **JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication**, and **audit logging**, making it a robust solution for managing sensitive information in a multi-cloud environment.

---
## Features
### 1. Multi-Cloud KMS Integration
- Securely store and retrieve secrets from **GCP Secret Manager**, **AWS Secrets Manager**, and **Azure Key Vault**.
- Uses provider-specific authentication mechanisms for enhanced security.

### 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Admin Role**: Configure KMS settings, view audit logs.
- **User Role**: Create, retrieve, and manage secrets.
- Access control enforced using JWT claims.

### 3. JWT Authentication
- Secure access using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**.
- **Token expiration** to prevent session hijacking.

### 4. Audit Logging
- Tracks all critical actions: **user signups, logins, secret creation, and retrieval**.
- Logs stored securely in **MongoDB Atlas**.

### 5. Secure Credential Handling
- **Base64 encoding** for sensitive credentials before storage.
- **Environment variables** used to store JWT secrets and database URIs.

---
## How It Works
### 1. User Authentication & Signup
- Users sign up with their **email, password, and KMS selection**.
- Passwords are securely stored using **bcrypt hashing**.
- On successful signup, an **audit event is logged**.

### 2. JWT-based Authentication
- Users log in using their email and password.
- Upon successful authentication, an **access token is generated**.
- The token is required for all subsequent API requests.

### 3. KMS Configuration
- Admins can configure KMS settings for their organization.
- Each userâ€™s KMS settings are stored in the database.

### 4. Secret Storage & Retrieval
- Users can store secrets in their selected KMS provider.
- The application securely authenticates with the KMS provider to store/retrieve secrets.
- Only authorized users can access their secrets.

### 5. Audit Logs
- Admins can retrieve audit logs to monitor activity.
- Logs include details of user actions with timestamps.

---
## Security Implementations
### 1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Admins** can configure KMS and view logs.
- **Users** can store and retrieve their own secrets.
- Unauthorized access attempts are **blocked and logged**.

### 2. JWT Authentication
- **Access tokens** are used for secure API access.
- Token expiration ensures **session security**.
- Tokens contain user roles for **access control enforcement**.

### 3. Secure Secret Storage
- Secrets are never stored directly in the database.
- Instead, they are securely stored in **GCP, AWS, or Azure KMS**.
- Only the secret reference is stored in MongoDB.

### 4. Environment Variables for Sensitive Data
- **JWT secrets, MongoDB URIs, and KMS credentials** are stored in **environment variables** to prevent exposure.

### 5. Audit Logging
- Every user action is **logged with a timestamp**.
- Admins can track all activity for **compliance and security monitoring**.
